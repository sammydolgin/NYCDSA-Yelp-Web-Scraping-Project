The objective of my project was to analyze the ways in which popular restaurant scores on Yelp differ between different geographic and demographic populations. To do this, I broke my analysis into 3 parts: Analyzing the top 5 most populated U.S. cities, analyzing regionally based clusters of highly populated U.S. cities, and analyzing mid-sized U.S. cities in comparison to highly populated U.S. cities.
